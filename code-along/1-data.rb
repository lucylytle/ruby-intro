# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 5+2
# puts 5/2.0

# Non-numbers
# puts "Hello, world!"
# puts "Tacos are" + " delish"

# True, False
puts true 
puts 3 == 2

# Nothing

# Variables
# food = 'tacos'
# quantity = 3

# puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"


# String manipulation
